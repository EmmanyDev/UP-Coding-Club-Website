This was a project a friend and I worked on for fun. Our high school already had a coding club, but we didn't have a website. I knew a lot
of HTML and CSS and my friend, Caleb, knew a lot about JavaScript and other API resources. We put our expertise together and spent 2 months creating our very own
UP Coding Club website.

There are some files that are incomplete, but aren't a part of the live website. In the Assets folder, you should find the index.html file, which is the complete 
live website that is currently on the web.
